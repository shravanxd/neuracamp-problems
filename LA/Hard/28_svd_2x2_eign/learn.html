<h2>Understanding Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</h2>

<p>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method in linear algebra for decomposing a matrix into three other matrices. For a given matrix A, SVD is represented as:</p>
<p>\(A = U \cdot S \cdot V^T\)</p>

<p>Here's a step-by-step method to calculate the SVD of a 2x2 matrix by hand:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Calculate \(A^T A\) and \(A A^T\)</strong>: Compute the product of the matrix with its transpose and the transpose of the matrix with itself. These matrices share the same eigenvalues.</li>
    <li><strong>Find the Eigenvalues</strong>: To find the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \). This results in a quadratic equation.</li>
    <li><strong>Compute the Singular Values</strong>: The singular values, which form the diagonal elements of the matrix S, are the square roots of the eigenvalues.</li>
    <li><strong>Calculate the Eigenvectors</strong>: For each eigenvalue, solve the equation \((A - \lambda I) \mathbf{x} = 0\) to find the corresponding eigenvector. Normalize these eigenvectors to form the columns of U and V.</li>
    <li><strong>Form the Matrices U, S, and V</strong>: Combine the singular values and eigenvectors to construct the matrices U, S, and V such that \(A = U \cdot S \cdot V^T\).</li>
</ol>

<p>This method involves solving quadratic equations to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors and normalizing these vectors to unit length.</p>
