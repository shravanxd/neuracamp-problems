    "qtext": "# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) using Jacobi Method\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nImplement a Python function to approximate the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a given 2x2 matrix using the Jacobi method. The function should not utilize the `numpy.linalg.svd` function to ensure a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical processes.\n\n## Mathematical Formulation\n\nFor a given 2x2 matrix $A$, the SVD is a factorization of the form:\n\n$$ A = U \\Sigma V^T $$\n\nwhere:\n- $U$ is an orthogonal 2x2 matrix.\n- $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.\n- $V^T$ is the transpose of an orthogonal 2x2 matrix $V$.\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```python\n[[2, 1], [1, 2]]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```python\n(array([[-0.70710678, -0.70710678],\n        [-0.70710678,  0.70710678]]),\n array([3., 1.]),\n array([[-0.70710678, -0.70710678],\n        [-0.70710678,  0.70710678]]))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe matrix $A$ is decomposed into $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V^T$ such that $A = U \\Sigma V^T$. The matrices $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal, and $\\Sigma$ contains the singular values.\n\n## Constraints\n- The input matrix $A$ is a 2x2 matrix.\n- Elements of $A$ are real numbers.\n\n## Input Format\n```python\n# One input:\n# a: list of lists, a 2x2 matrix for which to compute the SVD\n```\n\n## Output Format\n```python\n# A tuple containing three elements:\n# - A 2x2 array (U matrix)\n# - A 1D array (Singular values vector)\n# - A 2x2 array (V matrix)\n```\n",

    "learnAbout": "## Learning: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental matrix factorization technique in linear algebra. It decomposes a matrix $A$ into three other matrices: $U$, $\\Sigma$, and $V^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices, and $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $A$. This decomposition is useful in many applications, such as signal processing, statistics, and machine learning, as it provides insights into the geometric structure of the data represented by the matrix.\n\nThe Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm used to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. By extending this method, we can approximate the SVD of a matrix, which helps in understanding the transformation properties of the matrix without relying on high-level library functions. This approach enhances conceptual understanding and provides a deeper insight into the mechanics of matrix decompositions."
