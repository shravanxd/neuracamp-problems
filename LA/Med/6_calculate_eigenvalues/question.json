    "learnAbout": "Calculate Eigenvalues\n\nEigenvalues of a matrix offer significant insight into the matrix's behavior, particularly in the context of linear transformations and systems of linear equations.\n\n**Definition**\nFor a square matrix \\( A \\), eigenvalues are scalars \\( \\lambda \\) that satisfy the equation for some non-zero vector \\( v \\) (eigenvector):\n\n$$\nAv = \\lambda v\n$$\n\n**Calculation for a 2x2 Matrix**\nThe eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix \\( A \\), given by:\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nare determined by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n$$\n\\det(A-\\lambda I) = 0\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to a quadratic equation:\n\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(A)\\lambda + \\det(A) = 0\n$$\n\nHere, the trace of \\( A \\), denoted as \\( \\text{tr}(A) \\), is \\( a + d \\), and the determinant of \\( A \\), denoted as \\( \\det(A) \\), is \\( ad - bc \\). Solving this equation yields the eigenvalues, \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n**Significance**\nUnderstanding eigenvalues is essential for analyzing the effects of linear transformations represented by the matrix. They are crucial in various applications, including stability analysis, vibration analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in machine learning."
