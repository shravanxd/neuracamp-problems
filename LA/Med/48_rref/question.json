The RREF of a matrix is a special form where each leading entry in a row is 1, and all other elements in the column containing the leading 1 are zeros, except for the leading 1 itself.\n\n### Additional Details:\n\n- Diagonal entries can be 0 if the matrix is reducible (i.e., the row corresponding to that position can be eliminated entirely).\n- Some rows may consist entirely of zeros.\n- If a column contains a pivot (a leading 1), all other entries in that column should be zero.\n\nYour task is to implement the RREF algorithm, which must handle these cases and convert any given matrix into its RREF.\n\n### Example 1:\n\n**Input:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 2, -1, -4],\n    [2, 3, -1, -11],\n    [-2, 0, -3, 22]\n])\n\nrref_matrix = rref(matrix)\nprint(rref_matrix)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```python\n# array([\n#    [ 1.  0.  0. -8.],\n#    [ 0.  1.  0.  1.],\n#    [-0. -0.  1. -2.]\n# ])\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe given matrix is converted to its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) where each leading entry is 1, and all other entries in the leading columns are zero.\n\n### Constraints:\n\n- The input matrix is a 2D NumPy array.\n- The matrix can have dimensions $m \\times n$ where $1 \\leq m, n \\leq 100$.\n- Matrix elements are real numbers.\n\n## Input Format\n\n```python\nmatrix: np.ndarray  # A 2D NumPy array representing the input matrix to be reduced.\n```\n\n## Output Format\n\n```python\nnp.ndarray  # A NumPy array representing the matrix converted to its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF).\n```\n",

    "learnAbout": "## Learning About Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)\n\nThe Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of a matrix is a canonical form that simplifies the process of solving systems of linear equations. In RREF, each leading entry (also known as a pivot) in a row is 1, and all other elements in the column containing the leading 1 are zeros. Additionally, the leading 1 in each row is to the right of any leading 1s in the rows above it, and any rows consisting entirely of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.\n\nThe RREF is particularly useful in determining the rank of a matrix, solving linear systems, and finding the inverse of invertible matrices. The process of converting a matrix to its RREF involves a series of row operations: swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, and adding or subtracting a multiple of one row to another. These operations are used to systematically eliminate non-zero entries below and above each pivot, resulting in the simplified form."
