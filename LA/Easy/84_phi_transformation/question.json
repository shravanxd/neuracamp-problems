    "qtext": "Write a Python function to perform a Phi Transformation that maps input features into a higher-dimensional space by generating polynomial features. The transformation allows models like linear regression to fit nonlinear data by introducing new feature dimensions that represent polynomial combinations of the original input features. The function should take a list of numerical data and a degree as inputs, and return a nested list where each inner list represents the transformed features of a data point. If the degree is less than 0, the function should return an empty list.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n```python\ndata = [1.0, 2.0]\ndegree = 2\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\n[[1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 2.0, 4.0]]\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe Phi Transformation generates polynomial features for each data point up to the specified degree. For data = [1.0, 2.0] and degree = 2, the transformation creates a nested list where each row contains powers of the data point from 0 to 2.",
    "inputFormat": "Two inputs:\n- `data` (list of floats or integers): Input data points.\n- `degree` (integer): Degree up to which powers should be generated.\n\nConstraints:\n- If degree < 0, return an empty list.",
    "outputFormat": "A nested list where each row contains powers of the corresponding data point from 0 to degree.",
    "reason": "The Phi Transformation generates polynomial features from data points, enabling models to better capture nonlinear relationships by introducing polynomial feature expansions.",
