The orthogonal projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{L}$ is the vector on the line defined by $\\mathbf{L}$ that is closest to $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\n### Function Signature\n\n```python\ndef orthogonal_projection(v: List[float], L: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n```\n\n### Description\n\nGiven two vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{L}$, represented as lists of floats, compute the orthogonal projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{L}$. The result should be a list representing the projection vector, with each component rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThe orthogonal projection $\\mathbf{p}$ of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{L}$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{L}}{\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{L}} \\mathbf{L}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\cdot$ denotes the dot product of two vectors.\n\n### Constraints\n- The input vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{L}$ will have the same dimension.\n- $1 \\leq \\text{len}(\\mathbf{v}), \\text{len}(\\mathbf{L}) \\leq 1000$\n- Each component of $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{L}$ is a float in the range $-10^3 \\leq x \\leq 10^3$.\n\n### Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```python\nv = [3, 4]\nL = [1, 0]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```python\n[3.0, 0.0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe orthogonal projection of vector $[3, 4]$ onto the line defined by $[1, 0]$ results in the projection vector $[3, 0]$, which lies on the line $[1, 0]$.\n",

    "learnAbout": "### Orthogonal Projection\n\nOrthogonal projection is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, used to find the closest vector on a line (or plane) to a given vector. The projection of a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ onto another vector $\\mathbf{L}$ results in a vector that lies on the line defined by $\\mathbf{L}$ and is closest to $\\mathbf{v}$ in terms of Euclidean distance.\n\nMathematically, the orthogonal projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\mathbf{L}$ is calculated using the dot product. The formula $\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{L}}{\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{L}} \\mathbf{L}$ ensures that the resulting vector $\\mathbf{p}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{L}$ and minimizes the distance to $\\mathbf{v}$. This concept is widely used in computer graphics, optimization, and data science for tasks such as dimensionality reduction and feature extraction."
