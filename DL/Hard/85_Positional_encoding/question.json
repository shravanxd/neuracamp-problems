    "qtext": "Write a Python function to implement the Positional Encoding layer for Transformers. The function should calculate positional encodings for a sequence length (position) and model dimensionality (d_model) using sine and cosine functions as specified in the Transformer architecture. The function should return -1 if position is 0, or if d_model is less than or equal to 0. The output should be a numpy array of type float16.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n```python\nposition = 2\nd_model = 8\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n[[[ 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 1., 1.],\n  [ 0.8413, 0.0998, 0.01, 0.001, 0.5405, 0.995, 1., 1.]]]\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe function computes the positional encoding by calculating sine values for even indices and cosine values for odd indices, ensuring that the encoding provides the required positional information following the Transformer design.",
    "inputFormat": "Two inputs:\n- position: Integer representing the sequence length.\n- d_model: Integer representing the model dimensionality.",
    "outputFormat": "One output:\n- A numpy array of shape (1, position, d_model) with dtype float16 containing the positional encodings, or -1 if input conditions are invalid.",
    "reason": "Positional encodings allow the Transformer model to incorporate information about the order of tokens without recurrence or convolution. Sine functions are applied to even indices and cosine functions to odd indices to generate a unique encoding for each position.",
    "learnAbout": "The Positional Encoding layer provides sequential information in the Transformer architecture by adding unique sine and cosine based encodings to each token based on its position.\n\n**Mathematical Formulas:**\n- For even dimensions:\n```math\nPE(pos, 2i) = \\sin \\left( \\frac{pos}{10000^{\\frac{2i}{d_{model}}}} \\right)\n```\n- For odd dimensions:\n```math\nPE(pos, 2i+1) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{pos}{10000^{\\frac{2i}{d_{model}}}} \\right)\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- The output shape is (1, position, d_model).\n- Encoding uses sine for even indices and cosine for odd indices.\n- Designed to provide unique positional information to each input token.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Essential for sequence modeling tasks in Transformers.\n- Enables attention mechanisms to respect token order.\n- Used in language modeling, translation, summarization, and other NLP tasks."
