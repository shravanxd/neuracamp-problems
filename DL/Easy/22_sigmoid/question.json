The function should return the output rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe sigmoid function is mathematically defined as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n$$\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n\n```\nz = 0\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0.5000\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFor $z = 0$, the computation is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\sigma(0) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{0}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = 0.5\n$$\n\n## Constraints\n\n- The input $z$ is a real number.\n- The output should be rounded to four decimal places.\n\n",

    "reason": "The sigmoid function is defined as \u03c3(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z)). For z = 0, exp(-0) = 1, hence the output is 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5.",
    "learnAbout": "# Understanding the Sigmoid Function\n\nThe sigmoid function is a type of activation function commonly used in neural networks, particularly in binary classification problems. It maps any real-valued number into the range (0, 1), which can be interpreted as a probability. The function is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n$$\n\nwhere $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm. The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, which is why it is also known as the logistic function. Its derivative is useful for backpropagation in neural networks, as it helps in adjusting the weights during training."
