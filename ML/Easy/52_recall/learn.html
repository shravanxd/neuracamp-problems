<h2>Understanding Recall in Classification</h2>

<p>Recall is a metric that measures how often a machine learning model correctly identifies positive instances, also called true positives, from all the actual positive samples in the dataset.</p>

<h3>Mathematical Definition</h3>

<p>Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved and it's calculated using the following equation:</p>

\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
\]

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>True Positives (TP):</strong> The number of positive samples that are correctly identified as positive.</li>
    <li><strong>False Negatives (FN):</strong> The number of positive samples that are incorrectly identified as negative.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this problem, you will implement a function to calculate recall given the true labels and predicted labels of a binary classification task. The results should be rounded to three decimal places.</p>
