## Understanding Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning models that affect their performance and generalization ability.

### Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns. This results in high training accuracy but poor performance on unseen data (low test accuracy).

- **Indicators**: Training accuracy >> Test accuracy (large gap).

### Underfitting
Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This leads to poor performance on both training and test datasets.

- **Indicators**: Both training and test accuracy are low.

### Good Fit
A good fit occurs when the model generalizes well to unseen data, with training and test accuracy being close and both reasonably high.

### Remedies
- **For Overfitting**:
  - Use regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2 regularization).
  - Reduce model complexity by pruning unnecessary features.
  - Add more training data to improve generalization.
- **For Underfitting**:
  - Increase model complexity (e.g., add layers or features).
  - Train the model for more epochs.
  - Enhance feature engineering or input data quality.

### Mathematical Representation
1. Overfitting:
   $$ \text{Training Accuracy} - \text{Test Accuracy} > 0.2 $$

2. Underfitting:
   $$ \text{Training Accuracy} < 0.7 \, \text{and} \, \text{Test Accuracy} < 0.7 $$

3. Good Fit:
   $$ \text{Neither overfitting nor underfitting is true.} $$
