    "qtext": "Write a Python function to determine whether a machine learning model is overfitting, underfitting, or performing well based on training and test accuracy values. The function should take two inputs: training_accuracy and test_accuracy. It should return one of three values: 1 if Overfitting, -1 if Underfitting, or 0 if a Good fit. The rules for determination are as follows:\n\nOverfitting: The training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy (difference > 0.2).\nUnderfitting: Both training and test accuracy are below 0.7.\nGood fit: Neither of the above conditions is true.\n\nExample:\nInput:\ntraining_accuracy = 0.95, test_accuracy = 0.65\nOutput:\n'1'\n\nReasoning:\nThe training accuracy is much higher than the test accuracy (difference = 0.30 > 0.2). This indicates that the model is overfitting to the training data and generalizes poorly to unseen data.",

    "learnAbout": "Understanding Overfitting and Underfitting\n\nOverfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning models that affect their performance and generalization ability.\n\n**Overfitting**\n\nOverfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns. This results in high training accuracy but poor performance on unseen data (low test accuracy).\n\n**Indicators:** Training accuracy >> Test accuracy (large gap).\n\n**Underfitting**\n\nUnderfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This leads to poor performance on both training and test datasets.\n\n**Indicators:** Both training and test accuracy are low.\n\n**Good Fit**\n\nA good fit occurs when the model generalizes well to unseen data, with training and test accuracy being close and both reasonably high.\n\n**Remedies**\n\nFor Overfitting:\n- Use regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2 regularization).\n- Reduce model complexity by pruning unnecessary features.\n- Add more training data to improve generalization.\n\nFor Underfitting:\n- Increase model complexity (e.g., add layers or features).\n- Train the model for more epochs.\n- Enhance feature engineering or input data quality.\n\n**Mathematical Representation**\n\n- Overfitting:\n\n$$\n\\text{Training Accuracy} - \\text{Test Accuracy} > 0.2\n$$\n\n- Underfitting:\n\n$$\n\\text{Training Accuracy} < 0.7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Test Accuracy} < 0.7\n$$\n\n- Good Fit:\n\nNeither overfitting nor underfitting is true."
