The function should take in a 2D numpy array X and an integer degree, and return a new 2D numpy array with polynomial features up to the specified degree.\n\nExample:\nInput:\nX = np.array([[2, 3],\n                  [3, 4],\n                  [5, 6]])\n    degree = 2\n    output = polynomial_features(X, degree)\n    print(output)\n\nOutput:\n[[  1.   2.   3.   4.   6.   9.]\n     [  1.   3.   4.   9.  12.  16.]\n     [  1.   5.   6.  25.  30.  36.]]\n\nReasoning:\nFor each sample in X, the function generates all polynomial combinations of the features up to the given degree. For degree=2, it includes combinations like [x1^0, x1^1, x1^2, x2^0, x2^1, x2^2, x1^1*x2^1], where x1 and x2 are the features.",

    "learnAbout": "Understanding Polynomial Features\n\nGenerating polynomial features is a method used to create new features for a machine learning model by raising existing features to a specified power. This technique helps capture non-linear relationships between features.\n\n**Example**\n\nFor instance, given a dataset with two features ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), generating polynomial features up to degree 2 will create new features such as:\n\n- \\( x_1^2 \\)\n- \\( x_2^2 \\)\n- \\( x_1 \\times x_2 \\)\n\nThis expands the feature space, allowing a linear model to fit more complex, non-linear data.\n\n**Problem Overview**\n\nIn this problem, you will write a function to generate polynomial features for a given dataset. Specifically:\n\n- Given a 2D numpy array \\( X \\) and an integer degree, the function will create a new 2D numpy array with polynomial combinations of the features up to the specified degree.\n\n**Importance**\n\nThis method is useful in algorithms like polynomial regression, where capturing the relationship between features and the target variable requires polynomial terms. By understanding and implementing this technique, you can enhance the performance of your models on datasets with non-linear relationships."
