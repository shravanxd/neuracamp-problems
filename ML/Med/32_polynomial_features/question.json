    "qtext": "# Generate Polynomial Features\n\n## Description\n\nWrite a Python function to generate polynomial features for a given dataset. The function should take as input a 2D numpy array $X$ and an integer $d$, representing the degree of the polynomial features to be generated. The function should return a new 2D numpy array containing the polynomial features of the input data up to the specified degree.\n\nFor a given input matrix $X$ with $n$ samples and $m$ features, the output should include all polynomial combinations of the features up to degree $d$. This includes terms like $x_1^0, x_1^1, x_1^2, \text{and so on}$, as well as cross-product terms like $x_1^1 \times x_2^1$.\n\n## Constraints\n- The input $X$ is a 2D numpy array with shape $(n, m)$ where $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^4$ and $1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 10$.\n- The degree $d$ is a positive integer such that $1 \\\\leq d \\\\leq 5$.\n- The output should be a 2D numpy array with polynomial features.\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n\n```python\nX = np.array([[2, 3],\n              [3, 4],\n              [5, 6]])\ndegree = 2\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```python\n[[  1.   2.   3.   4.   6.   9.],\n [  1.   3.   4.   9.  12.  16.],\n [  1.   5.   6.  25.  30.  36.]]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFor each sample in $X$, the function generates all polynomial combinations of the features up to degree 2. This includes terms like $x_1^0, x_1^1, x_1^2, x_2^0, x_2^1, x_2^2$, and the cross-product $x_1^1 \\times x_2^1$.\n",
    "inputFormat": "X = np.array([[2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\ndegree = 2",
    "outputFormat": "[[  1.   2.   3.   4.   6.   9.], [  1.   3.   4.   9.  12.  16.], [  1.   5.   6.  25.  30.  36.]]",
    "reason": "For each sample in X, the function generates all polynomial combinations of the features up to the given degree. For degree=2, it includes combinations like [x1^0, x1^1, x1^2, x2^0, x2^1, x2^2, x1^1*x2^1], where x1 and x2 are the features.",
    "learnAbout": "## Polynomial Features\n\nPolynomial features are a way to enhance the feature set of a dataset by adding new features that are polynomial combinations of the original features. This is particularly useful in linear models where the relationship between the input features and the target variable is not linear. By introducing polynomial terms, the model can capture non-linear relationships. For example, given features $x_1$ and $x_2$, polynomial features of degree 2 would include $x_1^2$, $x_2^2$, and $x_1 \\times x_2$. These additional features allow the model to fit more complex patterns in the data."
