<h2>Understanding Polynomial Features</h2>

<p>Generating polynomial features is a method used to create new features for a machine learning model by raising existing features to a specified power. This technique helps in capturing non-linear relationships between features.</p>

<p>For instance, given a dataset with two features x1 and x2, generating polynomial features up to degree 2 will create new features such as x1^2, x2^2, and x1*x2. This expands the feature space, allowing a linear model to fit more complex, non-linear data.</p>

<p>In this problem, you will write a function to generate polynomial features for a given dataset. Given a 2D numpy array X and an integer degree, the function will create a new 2D numpy array with polynomial combinations of the features up to the specified degree.</p>

<p>This method is useful in algorithms like polynomial regression where capturing the relationship between features and the target variable requires polynomial terms.</p>

<p>By understanding and implementing this technique, you can enhance the performance of your models on datasets with non-linear relationships.</p>
