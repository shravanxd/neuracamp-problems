# The Phi coefficient

The Phi coefficient is a type of correlation coefficient , which is used when we need to find the correlation between two binary variables.
For example when we have two variables x and y , x being gender and y signifying the presence of heart disease. 
Both variables are binary and if we need to find a correlation between x and y then we can use the formula below :


$\phi = \frac{(x_{00} \cdot x_{11}) - (x_{01} \cdot x_{10})}{\sqrt{(x_{00} + x_{01})(x_{10} + x_{11})(x_{00} + x_{10})(x_{01} + x_{11})}}$




### Explanation of Terms:
- \(x_00\): The number of cases where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\).
- \(x_01\): The number of cases where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 1\).
- \(x_10\): The number of cases where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\).
- \(x_11\): The number of cases where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\).
