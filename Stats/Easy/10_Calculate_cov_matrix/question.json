    "qtext": "# Calculate Covariance Matrix\n\n## Problem Description\n\nWrite a Python function to calculate the covariance matrix for a given set of vectors. The function should take a list of lists, where each inner list represents a feature with its observations, and return a covariance matrix as a list of lists.\n\n## Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe covariance between two features $X$ and $Y$ is defined as:\n\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y}) $$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of observations, $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are individual observations, and $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$ are the means of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.\n\nThe covariance matrix is a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements of a given random vector. For a dataset with $m$ features, the covariance matrix $C$ is an $m \\times m$ matrix where the element at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is the covariance between the $i$-th and $j$-th features.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- The input list of lists will have at least two features.\n- Each feature list will have at least two observations.\n- All observations are real numbers.\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```python\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```python\n[[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe covariance between the two features is calculated based on their deviations from the mean. For the given vectors, both covariances are 1.0, resulting in a symmetric covariance matrix.\n\n## Input Format\n```python\nList[List[float]]\n```\n\n## Output Format\n```python\nList[List[float]]\n```\n\n## Learning\n\nThe covariance matrix is a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning, used to understand the linear relationship between features in a dataset. It quantifies how much two random variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates they move in opposite directions. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix represent the variance of each feature. Understanding the covariance matrix is crucial for techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.",
    "inputFormat": "One input:\n- A list of lists, where each inner list represents a feature and its observations across samples.",
    "outputFormat": "One output:\n- A list of lists representing the covariance matrix with each value rounded appropriately (default Python float precision).",
    "reason": "Calculating the covariance matrix helps quantify how features vary together in a dataset. It is a fundamental operation used in multivariate statistics and machine learning, providing insights into feature relationships.",
    "learnAbout": "Understanding Covariance Matrix\n\nThe covariance matrix is a core concept in statistics and machine learning, used to analyze the relationship between multiple variables. It measures the extent to which two variables change together.\n\n**Covariance** measures directional relationships:\n- Positive covariance: Variables increase together.\n- Negative covariance: One variable increases while the other decreases.\n\n**Covariance Matrix Construction:**\n- Given \\( n \\) features, the matrix is \\( n \\times n \\), with each element \\( (i, j) \\) representing the covariance between features \\( i \\) and \\( j \\).\n\n**Covariance Formula:**\n\n\\[ \\text{cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{m}(X_k - \\bar{X})(Y_k - \\bar{Y})}{m-1} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( X_k \\) and \\( Y_k \\) are observations.\n- \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\) are means.\n- \\( m \\) is the number of observations.\n\n**Applications:**\n- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Covariance matrices identify directions of maximum variance.\n- **Portfolio Optimization**: Covariance helps in understanding asset relationships in finance.\n- **Multivariate Analysis**: Covariance matrices are foundational for statistical modeling of multiple variables.\n\nUnderstanding and calculating the covariance matrix is fundamental for analyzing variable relationships and preparing data for many machine learning algorithms."
