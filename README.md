# Data Science Question Bank

This is a personal question bank I built while studying core data science and machine learning topics. It's structured like LeetCode, with questions categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and organized into six major subjects:

- **ML** – Machine Learning
- **DL** – Deep Learning
- **NLP** – Natural Language Processing
- **LA** – Linear Algebra
- **Prob** – Probability and Statistics
- **Stats/Easy** – Basic Statistical Concepts

Each question folder contains:
- A problem statement (either original or adapted from well-known resources)
- My solution (Python/Markdown, depending on the question)
- A brief explanation of the thought process or concept behind the solution

## Why I Created This

I wanted a space to actively practice and reinforce what I was learning during my MS in Data Science. Most of these questions are designed to:
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Test core concepts in a practical way
- Build deep understanding beyond just memorizing formulas

This also serves as a personal reference for revisiting tough topics before interviews or exams.

## Structure

Each subject folder contains subfolders or files grouped by difficulty:

```
├── ML/
│   ├── Easy/
│   ├── Medium/
│   └── Hard/
├── DL/
│   └── ...
├── NLP/
│   └── ...
...
```

Inside each question folder or file, you'll typically find:
- The question or prompt
- My solution (code or explanation)
- Notes or alternative approaches (if applicable)

## How to Use

- If you're preparing for a data science or ML interview, start with **ML** and **Stats** folders.
- If you're working on DL/NLP research or coursework, go deeper into **DL** and **NLP** sections.
- For math foundations or tricky derivations, check out **LA** and **Prob**.

This repo is meant to be practical and hands-on — you’re welcome to fork it, add your own solutions, or adapt it to your learning style.

## Contributions

This repo started as a solo learning project, but I’m happy to review PRs if others want to contribute well-formatted, explained questions or solutions.
