    "qtext": "Write a Python function to calculate the probability of observing exactly k events in a fixed interval using the Poisson distribution formula. The function should take k (number of events) and lam (mean rate of occurrences) as inputs and return the probability rounded to 5 decimal places.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n```python\nk = 3, lam = 5\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n0.14037\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe function calculates the probability for a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval, based on the mean rate of occurrences.",
    "inputFormat": "Two inputs:\n- An integer k representing the number of events.\n- A float lam representing the mean rate of occurrences.",
    "outputFormat": "One output:\n- A float representing the Poisson probability rounded to 5 decimal places.",
    "reason": "The Poisson distribution models the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval when the events occur independently at a constant mean rate.",
    "learnAbout": "The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the probability of a specific number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.\n\n**Mathematical Definition:**\n```math\nP(k;\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n```\nWhere:\n- (k): Number of events (non-negative integer)\n- (\\lambda): Mean number of events\n- (e): Euler's number (~2.718)\n\n**Key Properties:**\n- Mean = \\lambda\n- Variance = \\lambda\n\n**Applications:**\n- Modeling arrivals at a service station.\n- Modeling rare events over time (e.g., number of emails per hour).\n- Biology (e.g., mutations per DNA strand segment).\n- Traffic flow analysis (e.g., cars passing an intersection).\n\nPoisson distribution is essential in various fields where events happen randomly but at a constant average rate."
