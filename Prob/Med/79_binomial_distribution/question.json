    "qtext": "Write a Python function to calculate the probability of achieving exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success, using the Binomial distribution formula.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n```python\nn = 6, k = 2, p = 0.5\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n0.23438\n```\n\nReasoning:\nThe function calculates the Binomial probability, the intermediate steps include calculating the binomial coefficient, raising p and (1-p) to the appropriate powers, and multiplying the results.",
    "inputFormat": "Three inputs:\n- An integer n representing the number of trials.\n- An integer k representing the number of successes.\n- A float p representing the probability of success on each trial.",
    "outputFormat": "One output:\n- A float representing the binomial probability rounded to 5 decimal places.",
    "reason": "The Binomial distribution models the probability of a fixed number of successes in a set number of independent trials with a constant success probability.",
    "learnAbout": "The Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.\n\n**Mathematical Formula:**\n```math\nP(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n```\nWhere:\n- n: Total number of trials\n- k: Number of successes\n- p: Probability of success on each trial\n- \\binom{n}{k}: Binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n```math\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n```\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n- Calculate the binomial coefficient using factorials.\n- Raise p to the k-th power and (1-p) to the (n-k)-th power.\n- Multiply these values to find the probability.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Quality control and defect analysis.\n- Survey analysis and polling predictions.\n- Clinical trials and experiment modeling.\n- Scenarios where the outcome is success or failure (binary events).\n\nThe Binomial distribution is fundamental in statistics for modeling discrete success/failure outcomes across repeated trials."
