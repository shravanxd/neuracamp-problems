    "qtext": "# Binomial Distribution Probability\n\n## Description\n\nImplement a Python function to compute the probability of obtaining exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a probability $p$ of success. This probability is given by the Binomial distribution formula:\n\n$$ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\n\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, calculated as:\n\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```python\nn = 6\nk = 2\np = 0.5\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```python\n0.23438\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe probability of getting exactly 2 successes in 6 trials, with each trial having a success probability of 0.5, is calculated using the binomial distribution formula. The result is rounded to 5 decimal places.\n\n## Constraints\n- $0 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 1000$\n- $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$\n- $p$ is a floating-point number representing probability.\n\n## Input Format\n```python\nn: int  # number of trials\nk: int  # number of successes\np: float  # probability of success on each trial\n```\n\n## Output Format\n```python\nfloat  # binomial probability rounded to 5 decimal places\n```",

    "learnAbout": "## Learning: Binomial Distribution\n\nThe Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success $p$. It is widely used in statistics for scenarios where there are two possible outcomes (success/failure) in each trial. The probability mass function of the Binomial distribution is given by:\n\n$$ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\n\nThis formula calculates the likelihood of achieving exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials. The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $n$ trials, and the terms $p^k$ and $(1-p)^{n-k}$ represent the probabilities of these successes and failures, respectively."
