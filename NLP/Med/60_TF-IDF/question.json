    "qtext": "## Problem Description\n\nImplement the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to compute the relevance of query terms within a corpus of documents.\n\n### Task\n\nYou are required to implement a function `compute_tf_idf(corpus, query)` that calculates the TF-IDF scores for each word in the `query` against a given `corpus` of documents.\n\n### Definitions\n\n- **Term Frequency (TF)**: The number of times a term appears in a document divided by the total number of terms in that document.\n  \n  $$ \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{f_{t,d}}{\\sum_{t' \\in d} f_{t',d}} $$\n  \n  where $f_{t,d}$ is the frequency of term $t$ in document $d$.\n\n- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: A measure of how much information the word provides, calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term.\n  \n  $$ \\text{IDF}(t, D) = \\log\\left(\\frac{|D|}{|\\{d \\in D : t \\in d\\}|}\\right) $$\n  \n  where $|D|$ is the total number of documents.\n\n- **TF-IDF**: The product of TF and IDF.\n  \n  $$ \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t, D) $$\n\n### Constraints\n\n- The `corpus` is a list of documents, where each document is a list of words.\n- The `query` is a list of words for which TF-IDF scores are to be computed.\n- Each word in the corpus and query consists of lowercase English letters.\n- The function should return the TF-IDF scores rounded to five decimal places.\n\n### Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n\n```python\ncorpus = [\n    [\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"],\n    [\"the\", \"dog\", \"chased\", \"the\", \"cat\"],\n    [\"the\", \"bird\", \"flew\", \"over\", \"the\", \"mat\"]\n]\nquery = [\"cat\"]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```python\n[[0.21461], [0.25754], [0.0]]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe TF-IDF scores for the word \"cat\" are computed for each document in the corpus and rounded to five decimal places.",

    "outputFormat": "[[0.21461], [0.25754], [0.0]]",

    "learnAbout": "### Learning: TF-IDF\n\nThe Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is widely used in information retrieval and text mining. The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. This measure helps in identifying words that are more relevant to specific documents within the corpus."
